# PhotoViewCropper
This is a combination of uk.co.senab.photoview and com.edmodo.cropper. 
Both of these two projects are excellent, so I can put them together so easy with only tiny modification.
Now the Image can be zoomed and dragged by fingers pointed outside the selected zone, and roatated by Api as same as PhotoView, before being cropped.

Since the package names of PhotoView and Cropper are not changed, include this project equals include both the two projects, original codes relate to them don't need any modification
